# Once upon a time there was a patch of land, hidden away in the luminous mountains of Northern India. 

This patch of land was not just any kind of land, it was a magic place, where many creatures found their home, many others just came passing by and there were always birds in the sky, watching over the safety of those roaming the magic land called Devbala. Although hidden away, there had been some people that had found their place and home within its lush hills and beautiful trees.

Devbala is a place where many things are different from the outside world, here, unity and harmony with the surrounding nature has been the prime goal for those tending to, and living off the land. The mutual understanding of the family living on the land and nature manifested itself in various ways. Lycheeâ€™s grew there in the sweetest way imaginable, under one condition, let nature and its creatures do its work and tend do the ground with water and hand only, no man-made pesticides, no chemicals, so the bugs stay away, in its place, let the bees roam freely, the ants seem to be, carrying even more than 10 times their own weight. Spinach, liked it there so much, that besides the planted ones, we saw great groups of wild ones settling in, peacefully waving on the winds rolling down the mountains. Machines, although useful in some moments, are not being used, the pure connection with our Earth, better felt through work by hand.
